Get new credentials here.(https://develop.battle.net/access/clients) Same story as Mashery, you tell it your app name and it gives you a new Client ID and Client Secret. Rate limit is the same.
Get your access token.(https://develop.battle.net/documentation/guides/using-oauth/client-credentials-flow)
Blizzard actually does a decent job on that page describing how to get a token, but I'll tell you how I do it anyway:
Find your token URI. It's probably https://us.battle.net/oauth/token

Send a GET request with your client ID and Secret: https://us.battle.net/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=CLIENTID&client_secret=CLIENTSECRET

You'll get back JSON that looks like this:

 {
     "access_token":"asdfASDFasdfASDF",
     "token_type":"bearer",
     "expires_in":86399
 }
There's your access token, and "expires_in" tells you for how many seconds it'll work. It used to be for about a month, but now it looks like a day.

Use new hostnames for your requests. The paths themselves remain the same.
Old: us.api.battle.net
New: us.api.blizzard.com
Send your GET request.

Client Credentials Flow Recap
Instead of ?apikey=YOUR_PERMANENT_KEY you'll add ?access_token=YOUR_TEMPORARY_TOKEN
You get that token via a request to the OAuth Token URI, with grant_type=client_credentials and your client ID and Secret.
Since that requires your secret, you don't want to execute your token call on a client. You'll want a server somewhere to do that. Then your server can give the token to the client, and the client can make the rest of the calls with that.
